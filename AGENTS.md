Welcome to the **Uttr** repository. This project is a learning note-taking application built with React and the Microsoft Fluent Design System.

## Code Style
- Use JavaScript React functional components.
- Follow the linting rules configured by Create React App (`react-app` / `react-app/jest`).
- Use `rg` for searching the codebase instead of `grep -R` or `ls -R`.

## Dependency Management
- Use **npm** for installing packages.
- Install dependencies with:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

## Development
- Start the development server with:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

## Testing
- Run the test suite after making changes:
  ```bash
  npm test -- --watchAll=false
  ```
- Tests should pass before committing.

## Commit Guidelines
- Keep the working tree clean and commit logical changes with clear messages.
